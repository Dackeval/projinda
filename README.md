Projinda 2022 - ML - Fasttext

Language identifier 

Introduction 

My idea is to build a basic website where a user is able to do a text input and get a return of what language the user is writing in. The code will make use of Facebooks NLP ML ”Fasttext”. Where I suppose most of my work will go into understanding, configuring & improving. 

What is NLP and ML ? 
NLP is short for Natural Language Processing and is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI). It helps machines process and understand human languages so that it can do certain task with it. 
For example translating, summarization, ticket classification or spell checking. 

Machine learning (ML) is also a type of AI, which allows software applications to become more accurate at preticting outcomes without explicitly programming the software to do so. ML tend to need alot of "training data" to improve its precision. 


Main goals of the language identifier 

- Identify several different language inputs successfully
- Build a basic website for text entry and answer

The code will use:

Python as a base for the language identifier. 
HTML, CSS, JS for the website.
Installing Fasttext and Flask is also a requirement to be able to launch the website. 

How to use the website

Since the website will be hosted locally, the user first need to launch the main.py file in the repository.
To run the main.py file the user first need to enter in the terminal python main.py. The user will then be the address: http://127.0.0.1:5000, where the website then is launched. 

On the actual website the user is able to enter into the text-field whatever language the user wants to check for and press return. Once the user presses return the website will give a response on what language the model predicts this is.
