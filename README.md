Projinda 2022 - ML - Fasttext

Language identifier 

Introduction 

My idea is to build a basic website where a user is able to do a text input and get a return of what language the user is writing in. The code will make use of Facebooks NLP ML ”Fasttext”. Where I suppose most of my work will go into understanding, configuring & improving. 


Main goals of the language identifier 

- Identify several different language inputs successfully
- Build a basic website for text entry and answer

The code will use:

Python as a base for the language identifier. 
HTML, CSS, JS for the website.
